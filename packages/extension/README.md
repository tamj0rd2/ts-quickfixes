## Requirements

N/A

<!-- If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them. -->

## Extension Settings

N/A

<!-- Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something -->

## Known Issues

I've only covered a few use cases/scenarios. If your use case is not covered,
please open a github issue.

### Formatting

This extension/plugin won't do any formatting of generated code. You should
enable an editor option like `formatOnSave` or run a linter to fix the formatting
for you.
